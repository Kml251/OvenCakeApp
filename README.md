# Cake Oven Management Application üç∞

This Java Swing application simulates a bakery oven management system.
The oven can hold up to five cakes, and each cake includes a name, weight, best-before date, and timestamp 
when it was placed in the oven. 
The system uses a Queue (FIFO) data structure to model how cakes are handled in the oven.
